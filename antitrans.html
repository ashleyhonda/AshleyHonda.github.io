								<h2>Introduction</h2>
								<p>Tools: SQL, PowerBi
								<br>Type: Personal</p>
								<p>In June 2022, the Williams Institute of Law at UCLA released a report stating that over 1.6 million individuals in the United States, aged 13 and older, identify as transgender. That makes 0.6% of the population in the United States. Unfortunately, there has been a gradual increase in violence against the LGBTQ+ community, including transgender individuals, in recent years. Additionally, harmful policies and laws introduced by those in power further compound the challenges faced by the LGBTQ+ community. /p>
								<p>To provide a clearer picture of the situation, I analyzed some statistics on violence against the LGBTQ+ community. The UCLA School of Law found that transgender individuals are four times more likely to experience violence compared to cisgender individuals. Between June 2022 and April 2023, 356 anti-LGBTQ+ cases were documented, although many likely went unreported. These findings were reported by the Anti-Defamation League in collaboration with the LGBTQ+ advocacy group, GLAAD. /p>
								<p>The impact of this violence extends to the mental health and well-being of trans people. The Trevor Project's 2023 Mental Health Survey revealed that almost one in three LGBTQ+ young people struggled with poor mental health due to anti-trans legislation and policies. Shockingly, 41% of survey participants admitted to seriously considering suicide in the past year. </p>
								<p>Given these disheartening statistics and the powerful language used to describe the direct impact of policies on the lives of trans people, my goal was to initiate a project that could shed light on the number of proposed policies and legislations and understand how these numbers can impact the violence trans people face or their mental health </p>

								<h2>Methodology</h2>
								<p>To conduct this project, I relied on data collected by Erin Reed (@Erininthemorn) who lists every bill, what state they are being proposed in, the date, the status of the bill, and much more. Erin's extensive knowledge of politics, countless hours of research on proposed bills in congress, and personal identity as a queer individual make their data a highly credible source. Erin has utilized this data to create an informative heat map depicting safe spaces for trans individuals in the United States. For further details on the data collection methodology and credibility, please refer to Erin's up-to-date map and accompanying post available.</p>
								After collecting and cleaning the data, I formulated several questions:
								<li>How many anti-trans policies and pro-trans policies have been introduced to congress in total, and within 2023 so far?</li>	
								<li>What is the annual and monthly rate at which bills are being introduced?</li>
								<li>Which states are generating the most anti-trans bills, and are they also proposing any pro-trans bills?</li>
								<li>Which states are producing extremely harmful policies?</li>
								<li>What are the key issues addressed by these anti-trans bills?</li>
								<br>
								<h2>Analysis</h2>
								<p>Let's now examine the findings of my analysis. First, I wanted to collect the total number of introduced bills. Between 2022 and 2023, a total of 533 anti-trans bills were proposed, with 523 of them introduced in 2023 alone. In comparison, there were 311 pro-trans bills. These numbers indicate that out of the 844 bills concerning trans issues, 63% were anti-trans bills, while the remaining 37% were pro-trans bills. </p>
								<P>Next, I explored the frequency of trans policies being introduced on both an annual and monthly basis. According to my analysis, only 8 laws focusing on trans people were introduced in 2022, while as of September 2023, the number had risen significantly to 533. To delve deeper, we observed that in September 2022, only 1 anti-trans bill was proposed. In contrast, February 2023 saw the introduction of 124 bills, marking a drastic increase in such policies. </P>
								<P>Moving on, I examined the states that were producing the most harmful laws, essentially creating unsafe environments for trans people. The accompanying bar chart and map illustrate that Florida, Texas, Missouri, Tennessee, and Mississippi are the states where trans individuals may face significant challenges due to the introduction of policies that greatly impact their quality of life. </P>
								<P>Being able to see these numbers laid out can help others understand the fear that the trans community is experiencing. While statistics from the Trevor Project do report that pro-trans laws make trans people feel safe and protected, the amount of anti-trans laws being produced still outweighs the positives and makes those who live in states producing harmful policies feel fear and unsafe. New York Times followed up on the data collected by the A.D.L mentioned previously and quotes "Historical data indicates that increases in hate crimes are closely related to increases in hateful rhetoric from politicians and other influential figures" (NYT, 2023). Due to the large amount of laws that are being brought up in legislation, many comments that I have personally heard from trans people are surrounding fear of violence when leaving their home, thinking deeply and thoroughly on how to leave their home states in order to be safe or wondering when their current state may flip and they will become unsafe. Being able to see and understand how harmful the number increase in these anti-trans policies can lead to becoming a better ally to the trans community and push for diversity and inclusion.</P>
								<P>Lastly, I analyzed the main topics addressed in these proposed bills. The resulting bar chart reveals that the top five issues include gender affirming care, limitations on discussing LGBTQ+ topics in educational settings, bans on trans individuals participating in sports, bans on drag performances, and restrictions on access to gender-specific bathrooms. </P>
								<P>Let's delve further into the impact of one of these issues, gender affirming care, which constitutes 28% of the analyzed bills. Gender affirming care refers to age-appropriate and medically necessary treatments aimed at improving the well-being of transgender and non-binary individuals experiencing gender dysphoria or distress. Examples of gender affirming care range from simple acts like getting a haircut that aligns with one's gender identity to more complex procedures like gender reassignment surgery, typically reserved for consenting adults. A study conducted by the JAMA Network confirms that access to gender affirming care for transgender youth has led to a decrease in depression and suicide, with results indicating "60% lower odds of depression and 73% lower odds of suicidality" (JAMA, 2022). </P>
								<P>In relation to the prevailing trend of bills aimed at prohibiting gender-affirming care, the Human Rights Campaign has highlighted that, as a result of the already enacted bills, 30% of transgender youth will be deprived of vital care that has the potential to significantly improve their lives and help them embrace their identity. It is important to note that gender-affirming care also has bearing on how individuals are perceived by society. When individuals do not conform to society's predetermined physical standards for genders, there is a higher likelihood of being misgendered. Research from The Trevor Project indicates that individuals who are correctly addressed by their preferred pronouns experience reduced rates of suicidal ideation and attempts. Consequently, it can be inferred that those who are not addressed by their preferred pronouns may face an increased risk of experiencing suicidal thoughts or engaging in attempts. These policies, therefore, have a direct and adverse impact on transgender individuals across the United States.</P>
								<P>Hopefully this project can shed some understanding on the trans experience in America. Some steps to become a better ally is continue learning more about the trans experience and becoming familiar with their issues and start asking other's pronouns before assuming and trying to use gender neutral pronouns (they/them) if unsure!</P>
